What is Tracified#

Tracified powered by Blockchain technology facilitates a tamper proof platform that streamlines the data flow within a supply chain, introducing a novel crypto-economic model based on a reward/penalty concept, ensuring fair distribution of gains across the chain. The originality of the solution is further enhanced by its ability to get customized to suit the needs of a business.

A blockchain based platform that adds the crucial element ‘trust’ to traceability information. This applies to any buyer – seller scenario that occurs in a supply chain (not only the end-consumer). Trust is achieved by 3 pillars in tracified.1) blockchain based direct proofs 2) web of trust 3) security deposits by improving trust, tracified enables smarter purchasing decisions from the buyers side while making it possible for sellers who sell genuinely high quality products to prove their value.

Tracified Insights - Recall Management,https://help.tracified.com/docs/TracifiedInsights/RecallMan,"Recall Management

User Management

WHAT ARE PREREQUISITES FOR RECALL FUNCTIONALITY?

When defining the ‘workflow’ there should be a final stage named ‘Recall Stage’

HOW TO RECALL?

Recall Management comprises four main functionalities.

Recalls#

Already recalled products will be displayed in the table grid along with the details such as Batch ID, recalled reason, stage and date and time of recall.

Previously recalled batches can be searched by the recall name or filter the batches which have been recalled during a particular period of time through the date range filter option.

Recalls can be notified through the yellow speaker icon at the last column of each recalled product.

Recall Notices#

Notices about each recalled product can be created here using the icon at the ‘Notify’ column.

Once clicked on the icon, you will be shown a pop up window to add the recall notice.

Then the Recall Title and Batch Identifier will be auto retrieved from the system and filled, only the required notice can be typed and saved. A meaningful notice should be created conveying the receivers about the recall and its gravity.

Recalling a product#

In order to recall the required product, you should select the item, its and it's batch as in “Selecting an item” and “Selecting a batch”. To recall the selected batch go to ‘View Traceability Data’ and click on the three dots.

Click on the “Recall this batch” button.

Then an alert will pop up, asking you to confirm the action. Make sure you are so certain about this action as it is serious and cannot be reversed.

Once you click on the ‘Confirm’ button, you will get to fill a simple form including required details. If you don’t wish to proceed with this action of recalling, you can still choose the ‘Cancel’ option to terminate.

If you continue recalling the batch, fill in the fields in white by adding an appropriate name for the recall and also by adding the reason for the recall (ex: damaged, perished etc). Fields in grey are disables and cannot be edited as those data are retrieved from the system automatically. Once you click on the ‘Recall’ button, the selected batch will be recalled and will be recorded as a called back item.

A message will be displayed, saying the recall action was successful and the batch has automatically been transferred to the recall stage.

The recalled batch will be shown in red in order to let you know that there is something wrong with the particular batch

Recall Teams#

Recall Teams can be assigned to lead the recalls. Recall teams will document all recall actions, including consumer, distributor, supplier and public communications in order to reduce the risk of recall. Any number of team members can be added to a team and those teams can be edited or deleted as per the requirement.

Creating New Teams#

New recall teams can be added by clicking on the “Create New Team” button.

A meaningful and an identifiable team name should be given and the related recall should be selected to the team here. Each recall team should consist of at least one member and once all those fields are correctly filled, a team will be added and details will be saved successfully.

Viewing the team members#

Assigned team members of each team can be viewed through the yellow team button in the ‘Team Members’ column of the table.

Editing a team#

Select a team to be modified and only the number of members are allowed to be edited from a particular team. Once team members are changed or removed, and click on the “Update” button, the updated data will be saved successfully.

Deleting a team#

Select the team to be removed, and once confirmed the entire team will be permanently deleted from the system. Members of the team will not be removed from the system.

Recall Tasks#

Recall Tasks will be assigned to each recall team. The task name, description, created date and time, and the status of already recalled tasks, are displayed in the table. There are three states for recall tasks;

Planned - The task is yet to be performed.
In progress - The task is currently being worked on.
Completed - The task has been completed successfully.

The relevant state of each task should be chosen according to the current state.

Recall Notices#

Recall team members should send follow-up recall notices to customers, distributors, suppliers and other relevant authorities in order to minimize the risk of recall.

Recall notices and their required information will be shown in the table.

Recall notices should be sent from the ‘Notify’ option in the ‘Recall’ page.

Tracified Configs - Workflow,https://help.tracified.com/docs/TracifiedConfigs/workflow,"Workflow

Workflow creation can be done for all stages of the supply chain through Tracified Configs Portal.

You can add new stages to the process, as per your requirement, through the '+ Stage ' button. 

Add a stage name press Enter

Select the newly created stages and you can add relevant fields to a particular stages through the '+ Field' button.

Enter an appropriate field name and press Enter.

You can select the nature of the data as artifacts, list or single.

If you want to have your users add data using artifacts, you can choose the artifact function.

 

If you enable the ‘Required’ toggl button, filling the data fields will be mandatory.

Select the Merger Function (recommended ‘Carry Forward’)

If the list is selected, you can enter list items as you need, or even remove them while creating and also can select the required merge function.

If you choose the ‘single’ option, it will let the field officer users enter the data type you configure here.







Photo - this will enable the field officers to upload geo coded images.




Date and Time - this option will enable field officers to pick the date and time.




Number - this option will enable the field officers to enter numerical values.

If you toggle the prefix and postfix, you can enter some text that should be available before or after the numerical value. (ex: it can be a measurement unit or a value that is common to all)




Text - this option will enable the field officers to enter text

Here also you can enable the prefix and postfix option.

Once all these are correctly added, click on the ‘Publish’ button to get them added to the Workflow. (This may sometimes take a while as the whole Workflow process should be created within the system automatically)

One or more fields can be merged together to make a group. Click on the ‘Next: Group’ button to create a new group for the added fields.

Drag and drop the required fields to be grouped together to the dark grey box, and click on ‘Add to Group’ button. Then you will be asked to enter a suitable name for the new group. Enter a meaningful name and just click enter to make them grouped successfully.

WHAT ARE BLOCKCHAIN ACCOUNTS?

A mandatory requirement is for the wallet users to create their own Blockchain accounts. From here you can create multiple Blockchain accounts and a private and public key is generated for them for each account from which they could do their transactions.

Since Wallet is directly connected with Blockchain, it is mandatory to create a Blockchain account for each Wallet user.

After the initial login, you must create a Blockchain account by entering an account name and a password for transactions.
